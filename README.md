# NMusicPlayer V2

NMusicPlayer V2 is a complete rewrite of the original NMusicPlayer, now implemented in C#. This project is designed to provide a modern music player experience with support for multiple tracks and an auto-updater feature. 

**Note:** This project is a work in progress and may not yet be fully functional.

## Repository
- **Legacy (Archived):** [NMusic-Player](https://github.com/Nilonic/NMusic-Player)

## Release Types

- **Standalone:** The basic version of the player.
- **Standalone + Compiler Artifacts:** Includes additional files generated by the compiler.
- **Installable:** An installer package for easier deployment.

## Features

- **Play Multiple Tracks:** Enjoy the ability to play more than one track at a time.
- **Auto Updater:** An auto-updater feature is included but not fully functional yet.

## Requirements

- **NAudio:** This project uses the [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) library for audio playback.
- **.NET 8:** The application is self-contained with .NET 8, though compatibility may vary.

## Platform

- **Windows Only:** This application is designed to run on Windows operating systems.

## Missing Features

- **Discord RPC:** Integration with Discord RPC may be considered in the future, depending on development priorities.

## License

- **MIT License:** This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## Known Issues

### Compiler Warnings

- **Nullability Issues:**
  - `Cannot convert null literal to non-nullable reference type.`
  - `Non-nullable field 'audioFileReader' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor. Consider declaring the field as nullable`
  - `Nullability of reference types in type of parameter 'sender' of 'void MainGui.OnPlaybackStopped(object sender, StoppedEventArgs e)' doesn't match the target delegate 'EventHandler<StoppedEventArgs>' (possibly because of nullability attributes)`
  - `Nullability of reference types in type of parameter 'sender' of 'void MainGui.UpdateTimer_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)' doesn't match the target delegate 'EventHandler' (possibly because of nullability attributes)`

These warnings are related to nullability and type compatibility. They are on the list for future improvements.
